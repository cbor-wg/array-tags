--- abstract

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data
format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
need for version negotiation.

The present document makes use of this extensibility to define a
number of CBOR tags for typed arrays of numeric data, as well as two
additional tags for multi-dimensional and homogeneous arrays.  It is
intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the
CBOR tags defined.

Introduction        {#intro}
============

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, {{RFC7049}}) provides
for the interchange of structured data without a requirement for a
pre-agreed schema.
RFC 7049 defines a basic set of data types, as well as a tagging
mechanism that enables extending the set of data types supported via
an IANA registry.

Recently, a simple form of typed arrays of numeric data have received
interest both in the Web graphics community {{TypedArray}} and in
the JavaScript specification {{TypedArrayES6}}, as well as in
corresponding implementations {{ArrayBuffer}}.

Since these typed arrays may carry significant amounts of data, there
is interest in interchanging them in CBOR without the need of lengthy
conversion of each number in the array.

This document defines a number of interrelated CBOR tags that cover
these typed arrays, as well as two additional tags for
multi-dimensional and homogeneous arrays.
It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of
the tags defined.

Terminology         {#terms}
------------

<!--
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119 {{ !RFC2119}}.
 -->

{::boilerplate bcp14}

The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
"octet".
Where bit arithmetic is explained, this document uses the notation
familiar from the programming language C (including C++14's 0bnnn
binary literals), except that the operator "\*\*" stands for
exponentiation.

Typed Arrays        {#typedarrays}
============

Typed arrays are homogeneous arrays of numbers, all of which are
encoded in a single form of binary representation.  The concatenation
of these representations is encoded as a single CBOR byte string
(major type 2), enclosed by a single tag indicating the type and
encoding of all the numbers represented in the byte string.

Types of numbers        {#dataTypes}
------------

Three classes of numbers are of interest: unsigned integers (uint),
signed integers (twos' complement, sint), and IEEE 754 binary floating
point numbers (which are always signed).  For each of these classes,
there are multiple representation lengths in active use:

| Length ll | uint   | sint   | float     |
|         0 | uint8  | sint8  | binary16  |
|         1 | uint16 | sint16 | binary32  |
|         2 | uint32 | sint32 | binary64  |
|         3 | uint64 | sint64 | binary128 |
{: #lengths title="Length values"}

Here, sintN stands for a signed integer of exactly N bits (for
instance, sint16), and uintN stands for an unsigned integer of exactly
N bits (for instance, uint32).  The name binaryN stands for the number
form of the same name defined in IEEE 754.

Since one objective of these tags is to be able to directly ship the
ArrayBuffers underlying the Typed Arrays without re-encoding them, and
these may be either in big endian (network byte order) or in little
endian form, we need to define tags for both variants.

In total, this leads to 24 variants.  In the tag, we need to express
the choice between integer and floating point, the signedness (for
integers), the endianness, and one of the four length values.

In order to simplify implementation, a range of tags is being
allocated that allows retrieving all this information from the bits of
the tag: Tag values from TBD64 to TBD87. <!-- (0x40 to 0x57) -->

The value is split up into 5 bit fields: TDB0b010\_f\_s\_e\_ll, as
detailed in {{fields}}.

| Field    | Use                                                   |
| TBD0b010 | a constant such as '010', to be defined               |
| f        | 0 for integer, 1 for float                            |
| s        | 0 for unsigned integer or float, 1 for signed integer |
| e        | 0 for big endian, 1 for little endian                 |
| ll       | A number for the length ({{lengths}}).                |
{: #fields title="Bit fields in the low 8 bits of the tag"}

The number of bytes in each array element can then be calculated by
`2**(f + ll)` (or `1 << (f + ll)` in a typical programming language).
(Notice that f and ll are the lsb of each nibble (4bit) in the byte.)

In the CBOR representation, the total number of elements in the array
is not expressed explicitly, but implied from the length of the byte
string and the length of each representation.  It can be
computed inversely to the previous formula: `bytelength >> (f + ll)`.

For the uint8/sint8 values, the endianness is redundant.
Only the big endian variant is used.
The little endian variant of sint8 MUST NOT be used, its tag is marked as
reserved.
As a special case, what would be the little endian variant of uint8 is
used to signify that the numbers in the array are using clamped
conversion from integers, as described in more detail in Section 7.1
of {{TypedArrayUpdate}}.

Additional Array Tags
=====================

This specification defines two additional array tags.
The Multi-dimensional Array tag can be combined with classical CBOR
arrays as well as with Typed Arrays in order to build
multi-dimensional arrays with constant numbers of elements in the
sub-arrays.
The Homogeneous Array tag can be used to facilitate the ingestion of
homogeneous classical CBOR arrays, providing performance advantages
even when a Typed Array does not apply.

Multi-dimensional Array
-----------------------

Tag:
: TBD40

Data Item:
: array (major type 4) of two arrays, one array (major type 4) of
  dimensions, and one array (major type 4, a Typed Array, or a
  Homogeneous Array) of elements

A multi-dimensional array is represented as a tagged array that
contains two (one-dimensional) arrays.  The first array defines the dimensions of the
multi-dimensional array (in the sequence of outer dimensions towards
inner dimensions) while the second array represents the contents
of the multi-dimensional array.  If the second array is itself tagged
as a Typed Array then the element type of the multi-dimensional array
is known to be the same type as that of the Typed Array.  Data in
the Typed Array byte string consists of consecutive values where the
last dimension is considered contiguous (row-major order).

{{ex-multidim}} shows a declaration of a two-dimensional array in the
C language, a representation of that in CBOR using both a
multidimensional array tag and a typed array tag.

~~~
uint16_t a[2][3] = {
  {2, 4, 8},   /* row 0 */
  {4, 16, 256},
};

<Tag TBD40> # multi-dimensional array tag
   82       # array(2)
     82      # array(2)
       02     # unsigned(2) 1st Dimension
       03     # unsigned(3) 2nd Dimension
     <Tag TBD65> # uint16 array
       4c     # byte string(12)
         0002 # unsigned(2)
         0004 # unsigned(4)
         0008 # unsigned(8)
         0004 # unsigned(4)
         0010 # unsigned(16)
         0100 # unsigned(256)
~~~
{: #ex-multidim title="Multi-dimensional array in C and CBOR"}

{{ex-multidim1}} shows the same two-dimensional array using the
multidimensional array tag in conjunction with a basic CBOR array
(which, with the small numbers chosen for the example, happens to be
shorter).

~~~
<Tag TBD40> # multi-dimensional array tag
   82       # array(2)
     82      # array(2)
       02     # unsigned(2) 1st Dimension
       03     # unsigned(3) 2nd Dimension
     86     # array(6)
       02      # unsigned(2)
       04      # unsigned(4)
       08      # unsigned(8)
       04      # unsigned(4)
       10      # unsigned(16)
       19 0100 # unsigned(256)
~~~
{: #ex-multidim1 title="Multi-dimensional array using basic CBOR array"}

Note that these arrays are in "row major" order; if a representation
for "column major" order arrays is desired, it can be defined
analogously with a new tag (but the present document does not).


Homogeneous Array
-----------------

Tag:
: TBD41

Data Item:
: array (major type 4)


This tag provides a hint to decoders that the array tagged by it has
elements that are all of the same application type.  The element type
of the array is thus determined by the application type of the first
array element.  This can be used by implementations in strongly typed
languages while decoding to create native homogeneous arrays of
specific types instead of ordered lists.

Which CBOR data items constitute elements of the same application type
is specific to the application.  However, type systems of programming
languages have enough commonality that an application should be able
to create portable homogeneous arrays.

{{ex-homogeneous}} shows an example for a homogeneous array of
booleans in C++ and CBOR.

~~~
bool boolArray[2] = { true, false };

<Tag TBD41>  # Homogeneous Array Tag
   82           #array(2)
      F5        # true
      F4        # false
~~~
{: #ex-homogeneous title="Homogeneous array in C++ and CBOR"}

{{ex-homogeneous1}} extends the example with a more complex structure.

~~~
typedef struct {
  bool active;
  int value;
} foo;
foo myArray[2] = { {true, 3}, {true, -4} };

<Tag TBD41>
    82  # array(2)
       82  #  array(2)
             F5  # true
             03  # 3
       82 # array(2)
             F5  # true
             23  # -4
~~~
{: #ex-homogeneous1 title="Homogeneous array in C++ and CBOR"}



Discussion
==========

Support for both little- and big-endian representation may seem out of
character with CBOR, which is otherwise fully big endian.  This
support is in line with the intended use of the typed arrays and the
objective not to require conversion of each array element.

This specification allocates a sizable chunk out of the single-byte
tag space.  This use of code point space is justified by the wide use
of typed arrays in data interchange.

Applying a Homogeneous Array tag to a Typed Array would be redundant
and is therefore not provided by the present specification.

IANA Considerations
============

IANA is requested to allocate the tags in {{tab-tag-values}}, with the
present document as the specification reference.  (The reserved value
is reserved for a future revision of typed array tags.)

*) TBD40 data item: second element of outer array in data item is
native CBOR array (major type 4) or Typed Array (one of Tag TBD64..TBD87)

RFC editor note: Please replace TBDnn by the tag numbers
allocated by IANA throughout the document and delete this note.
IANA note:  To make the calculations work, TDB64 to TBD87 need to come
from a contiguous range the start of which is divisible by 32.

TO DO: The WG needs to figure out whether it is OK to spend 24 "good"
(1+1 byte) tags for this, whether this all goes to 1+2 byte tags, or
whether maybe the layout of the bits in the tag should change to move
the larger datatypes into the 1+2 range and just the 8-bit ones into
the 1+1 range.

Security Considerations
============

The security considerations of RFC 7049 apply; special attention is
drawn to the second paragraph of Section 8 of RFC 7049.  The tags
introduced here are not expected to raise security considerations
beyond those.
